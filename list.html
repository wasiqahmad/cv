The Jews who descended <strong>from Abraham were never</strong>
<em> really the nation we</em>
 associate with greatness.  They did not conquer and build a great empire
  like the Romans did or build large monuments like the Egyptians did with
the pyramids. Their fame comes from the Law and Book which they wrote; from
 some remarkable individuals that were Jewish; and that they have survived 
 as a somewhat different people group for thousands of years.  Their 
 greatness is not because of anything they did, but rather what was done
 to and through them.  The promise says repeatedly “I will …” – that would
be the power behind the promise.  Their unique greatness happened because 
God made it happen rather than some ability, conquest or power of their own.
